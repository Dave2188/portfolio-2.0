			"This React app was built for tracking job sites in the oil field. The user can add, edit, move, delete, and print job material lists. The forms also allow the addition of dynamic sections as needed along with using gps location. When a job list is printed, it takes the gps location and generates a QR code so others can receive directions with ease. This project was a valuable experience in the back-end development of applications and deploying them across multiple hosting services.",

			"The portfolio page you're browsing now was built using Vite/Vue and Tailwind. After learning React, I wanted to broaden my skill set a little further. I saw this as a perfect opportunity to challenge myself with what I've learned by updating my portfolio page. The Composition API certainly made it easier to keep related data together. However, in my opinion it loses the pre-defined structure of the Options API. I do agree with the overwhelming consensus;  Vue has less of a learning curve when compared to React, though it is not without its quirks. ",

I took it upon myself to work through these issues as they presented themselves and learned a ton in the process.",
